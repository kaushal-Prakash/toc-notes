Module 4: Pushdown Automata (PDA)** — a key topic that connects **finite automata** with **context-free grammars (CFGs)**.
Let’s break it down clearly and simply 👇

---

## 🧩 **What is a Pushdown Automaton (PDA)?**

A **Pushdown Automaton (PDA)** is like a **Finite Automaton (FA)** but with an extra memory structure — a **stack**.

👉 This makes PDA more powerful than FA and allows it to recognize **Context-Free Languages (CFLs)**.

---

### **Formal Definition**

A PDA is represented as a **7-tuple:**

```
M = (Q, Σ, Γ, δ, q₀, Z₀, F)
```

Where:

| Symbol | Meaning                                            |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Q**  | Set of finite states                               |
| **Σ**  | Input alphabet                                     |
| **Γ**  | Stack alphabet (symbols that can be pushed/popped) |
| **δ**  | Transition function                                |
| **q₀** | Start state                                        |
| **Z₀** | Initial symbol on stack (bottom marker)            |
| **F**  | Set of final states                                |

### **Language Accepted by PDA**

Example from your notes:

```
L = { aⁿ bⁿ | n ≥ 0 }
```

✅ This is a **Context-Free Language** (CFL), recognized by PDA.

## 🧠 **Working of a PDA**

The PDA uses three things at any time:

1. **Current state**
2. **Current input symbol**
3. **Top of the stack**

It then decides:

* What new state to go to
* Whether to **push** or **pop** symbols on the stack.

---

### **Transition Function**

```
δ : Q × (Σ ∪ {ε}) × Γ → P(Q × Γ*)
```

This means:

* Current state ∈ Q
* Current input symbol ∈ Σ (or ε for empty input)
* Current stack top ∈ Γ
* Outputs: new state and new stack content (could be multiple possibilities)

---

## ⚙️ **Example Transition Explanation**

### Example 1:

```
δ(p, a, Z₀) = (q, aZ₀)
```

✅ Meaning:

* PDA is in **state p**.
* Input symbol **a** is being read.
* **Z₀** is on top of the stack.
* Then PDA goes to **state q**, and **pushes ‘a’** on top of the stack (so stack becomes `aZ₀`).

✅ Visually:

```
Before: [Z₀]
After:  [aZ₀]
```

So, it **pushes ‘a’** onto the stack.

---

### Example 2:

```
δ(p, a, Z₀) = (q, ε)
```

✅ Meaning:

* PDA is in **state p**, reads **a**, and **Z₀** is on top of the stack.
* It goes to **state q**, **removes Z₀** from the stack (because ε means nothing left).

✅ Visually:

```
Before: [Z₀]
After:  []
```

So, it **pops Z₀** (deletes it).

## 🧩 **Summary of Symbols**

| Symbol  | Represents                                |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **p**   | Present state                             |
| **q**   | Next state                                |
| **a**   | Input symbol being read                   |
| **Z₀**  | Symbol at top of stack                    |
| **aZ₀** | New stack content (a pushed on top of Z₀) |
| **ε**   | Pop operation (remove top of stack)       |

---

## 🧠 **Key Idea**

* **Push** operation → adds symbol to the top of stack
* **Pop** operation → removes the top symbol
* PDA accepts input if:

  1. It reaches a **final state**, or
  2. The **stack becomes empty**

## ✅ **Takeaway**

| Concept       | Finite Automata | Pushdown Automata                      |         |          |
| ------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------- | -------- |
| Memory        | No memory       | Has a stack (infinite memory in depth) |         |          |
| Language Type | Regular         | Context-Free                           |         |          |
| Example       | `{ aⁿbⁿ         | n≥0 }` ❌                               | `{ aⁿbⁿ | n≥0 }` ✅ |
